## Description

Radioroom is a music media application and website that allows users to listen, share, sync and discuss music in a collaborative space. With this application, we aim to allow users to all join a room together and enjoy a space where they can listen to music at the same time regardless of where they are, and also be able to share new music with new users and discuss music within the group. Other features we aim to provide are:

- Add songs to the current playlist
- Vote on the songs available in the playlist giving them an upvote if they like it or down vote it if the don't
- Listen to music simultaneously
- View how many people are in the room
- Skip the song if there are too many down votes
